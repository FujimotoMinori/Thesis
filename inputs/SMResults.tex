\chapter{Results}

The results of the likelihood fit are shown in this sections. The fitting is validated with several aspects.
The 2lep only fitting results are shown.

We show the results for the model inspection and discuss the goodness of the fit model for the \tlep channel
in this section.

\subsubsection{Prefit plots}

Figure \ref{fig:fit_2lep_prefit} shows the pre-fit plots of the analysis regions entering in the \tlep fit only model;
in particular, \mjjtag distributions in \Zjets CRs are shown and the neural network scores distributions
are shown in the SRs, only the left side bins are plotted using real data as well.

\subsubsection{Prefit tables}

Table \ref{tab:2lepPrefitYield} shows the expected yields for signal and background processes
in all the control and signal regions for the \tlep channel.

\subsubsection{Asimov Fit Results}
A fit to the full range of SRs using Asimov data is performed only with the 2 lepton channel.

Figures \ref{fig:fit_2lep_fcc_asimov}-\ref{fig:fit_2lep_corr_all}-\ref{fig:fit_2lep_ranking_all}
show the pulls, the correlation and the ranking respectively of the NPs used in the fit.

In particular, the following constraints have been found:
\begin{itemize}
       \item \texttt{SysTheoryQCD\_Z} is the QCD scale uncertainty on the Z+jets samples.
       The large shape impact of the resolved SR cause this constraint;
       we will provide more checks in section \ref{sec:fit_decorrStudies}.

       \item \texttt{SysMJJREWEIGHT\_100per} (L2\_Fat1 for merged and L2\_J2 for resolved)
       are the \mjjtag reweighting uncertainties for merged and resolved regions.
       These are large uncertainties and are expected since we take the \mjjtag reweighting as 100\% uncertainties.
       We rely on the constraints coming from data to this uncertainty.

       \item \texttt{SysMODEL\_Z\_MGPy8}
       is the shape difference between Sherpa Z+jets samples (after the \mjjtag reweighting applied)
       and the MadGraph Z+jets samples (no \mjjtag reweighting applied).
       These are expected since there is a well-known modelling difference between two generators.

\subsubsection{Left Bins Data Fit Results}

According to the unblinding strategy, the fit model is inspected in the left side of our SRs using data fit;
the goal is to spot some problematic pulls that might appear in the final data fit.

Figures \ref{fig:fit_2lep_fcc_left}-\ref{fig:fit_2lep_corr_left}
show the pulls and the correlations respectively of the NPs used in the fit.

\begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/2lep/FitResults/NP_allExceptGammas_DataLeftBins.pdf}
        \caption{Fit cross-check, unconditional fit ($\mu=1$) to data in the left bins only, for the 2 lepton channel only.}

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Correlations for unconditional fit ($\mu=1$) to data in the left bins only, for the 2 lepton channel only.}
       \label{fig:fit_2lep_corr_left}
\end{figure}

Similar constraints as found in the Asimov fit are found and confirmed in the left bins only fit.
They have been already discussed.
In addition, some pulls are found, they are:

\begin{itemize}

       \item \texttt{SysTheoryQCD\_Z} it is coming from the data modelling of the left side bins;
       we will provide more checks in section \ref{sec:fit_decorrStudies}.

       \item \texttt{SysMODEL\_Z\_MGPy8} it is coming from the differences in the generators affecting our phase space;
       we can rely on the data fit for this uncertainty.

       \item \texttt{SysJET\_Pileup\_OffsetMu} is pile-up related uncertainty.
       This systematic uncertainty is expected to have a large shape effect on the forward jets.

       \item \texttt{SysFATJET\_FatJetTagSF\_Gammajet\_Modelling} this is the uncertainty related to the boosted tagger SF efficiency.
       We can see this pull since this uncertainty has a large effect in Merged CR.
