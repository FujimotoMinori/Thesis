\chapter{EW VV+jj fiducial cross section measurement}
\label{chap:crosssection}
A measurement of cross-section in the phase space of the geometric and kinematic requirements of the measurement, denoted as fiducial volume, is provided.
Measured cross section in a fiducial volume is called fiducial cross-section which allows easier comparison with theoretical predictions. 
This chapter describes the definition of the fiducial volume and the cross-section measurement procedure.

\section{Fiducial volume definition}
The fiducial region is defined by applying selections at MC samples using the stable final state particle. 
These cuts are chosen to be similar to those at reconstruction level described in chapter~\ref{chap:eventselection}, in which includes the detector effects in the simulation.
The all selection cut to defined the fiducial volume is summerized in table~\ref{tab:}.
