\chapter{Background Modeling and Estimation}
The study dedicated to the modeling of the major background is shown in this chapter.

\section{Z+jets modeling}
There is a known mis-modelling issue with the Sherpa~2.2.1 V+jets samples. This mis-modelling is seen in the $m^{tag}_{jj}$ distribution as a slope when compare the data over MC. (Figure~\ref{fig:2lep_mtag_before_rw}).

The $Z$+jets production is the leading background for the 2-lepton analysis and contributes significantly for the 0-lepton analysis. The comparison of distributions from data and MC for various kinematic variables after re-weighting in the 2-lepton Z+jets merged and resolved control region are shown in Figure \ref{fig:2lep_zjets_merged_CR} and Figure \ref{fig:2lep_zjets_resolved_CR}
respectively.
