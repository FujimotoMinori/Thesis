\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:eventselection}
%overview
First the preselection cuts are applied including basic event cleaning and the trigger requirements, then the specific event selection is applied to the each 0,1,2-lepton channels.
For the main event selection, first the selection of the one $W/Z$ boson decaying leptonically is selected. 
The events are categorized into two regions depends on the type of the jets included. The events has one or more large-R jets are categorized as merged category, otherwise resolved category.  
Then in each channel, the forward jets and the hadronically decaying boson is selected and the Signal region (SR) and the Control region (CR) is defined separately in merged category and resolved category. Finally the selection to enhance the VBS topology is applied before using the machine learning approach to get the final discriminant. The SRs are the regions optimized to maximize the significance of the signal over background, and the CRs are region which is the specifical background-dominant, used for constraining the backgrounds. 

%\section{Preselection}
%Firstly some pre-selection on the Triggers, event cleaning selections are applied to get the available events and to reject the problematic events. The same selection is applied both for data and MC samples.
%The selections with respect to the number of jets and leptons at minimum is applied, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:presel_CxAOD}.

\subsection{Selection of the leptonically decaying Boson}
The selection to reconstruct the leptonically decaying $W/Z$ boson is applied separately in each lepton channel. \\ \\
\noindent\textbf{\sf{0-lepton}}  \\
In 0-lepton channel, a high amount of MET is expected originated from two neutrinos in the final state. Cuts on $E^{miss}_T$ ( $>$ 200~GeV) and $E^{miss,track}_T$ ( $>$ 50~GeV) is applied. The QCD-induced multijet background is significant in 0-lep channel. 
To suppress its contribution, several cuts are applied related to the direction of MET and the jet which can be significantly mis-measured : $\Delta\phi(\met,\mpt) < \pi/2$, $\min(\Delta\phi(\met,j)) > \pi/6$ and, $\Delta\phi(\met, V_{had}) > \pi/9$. \\ \\ 
\noindent\textbf{\sf{1-lepton}}  \\
One tight-lepton with $p_T > 28~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $E^{miss}_T > 80~\mathrm{GeV}$is required. In 1-lepton channel there are significant contribution from t\bar{t} background hence b-veto is applied to reduce its contribution.\\ \\
\noindent\textbf{\sf{2-lepton}}  \\
Two same flavor loose-leptons with the leading (sub leading) lepton satisfying $p_T$ > 28~GeV ( $p_T$ > 20~GeV) and an invariant mass of the lepton system ( m$_{ll}$ ) close to the Z boson mass are requested. Depending on the lepton pair (ee, $\mu\mu$) different mass
window requirements are applied; For electrons, $83<m_{ee}<99 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ is applied. For muons $p_{T,ll}$-dependent mass window is required in order to recover the dimuon mass resolution degradation at high-$p_{T,ll}$ \cite{EXOT-2016-29}.
\begin{equation*}
\left(85.6-0.0117 p_{\mathrm{T}, \ell \ell}\right)<m_{\mu \mu}<\left(94.0+0.0185 p_{\mathrm{T}, \ell \ell}\right) ~\mathrm{GeV}
\end{equation*}
In addition, muons are required to be within an |$\eta$| < 2.5 and to be of opposite charge. 
The opposite charge requirement is not requested for electrons which are more susceptible to mis-identification due to the conversions of photons from bremsstrahlung.

%Data and MC distributions of relevant lepton distribution at the early stage of the selection are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2lepLeptons}.

%\section{VBS topology selection}
\subsection{Selection of the tagging jet}
It is expected for VBS process to have a pair of small-R jets in the forward-backward directions, referred to as tagging jets.
Requiring the tagging jets is the particular feature of the VBS process, and it helps separating signal process a lot from the main backgrounds.
The tagging jets are selected from the small-R jets, and must not be identified as b-tagged jets to suppress the contribution of the top-quark background. 
The fJVT selection is applied to suppress the pileup jets contibutions. Tagging jet candidates are selected from the pairs of the jets in opposite hemisphere, $\eta_{\operatorname{tag} j_{1}} \cdot \eta_{\operatorname{tag} j_{2}}<0$, each of which have p$_T > 30~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 4.5$, and the one with the highest dijet invariant mass is chosen.  
Selected tagging jets are required to have the dijet invariant mass, $m^{tag}_{jj} > 400$GeV.
The tagging jets are selected prior to the signal jets. This order of the jet selection is optimized to maximize the signal sensitivity.
Figure~\ref{fig:Mtagjj} shows the $m^{tag}_{jj}$ distribution before selecting the analysis regions in 2-lepton channel.
The $m^{tag}_{jj}$ reweighting, which is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:modeling}, is applied before defining the analysis regions to correct the Z+jet modeling.
\begin{figure}[ht]

Details are described in Chapter~\ref{chap:modeling}. $m^{tag}_{jj} > 400$GeV cut will be applied to these distribution to enhance the signal sensitivity.}
    \label{fig:Mtagjj}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Selection of hadronically decaying boson}
Hadronically decaying boson ($V_{had}$) is reconstructed as a single large-R jet or a pair of small-R jets in each merged selection or resolved selection. \\ \\
\noindent\textbf{\sf{Merged selection}}  \\
The signal large-R jet candidate (sigJ) is selected after removing overlapping with tagging jets of $|\Delta R|<1.4$. The sigJ is required to have a $p_{T} \geq ~200 \mathrm{GeV}$, $|\eta| < 2.0$, and not overlapping with leptons of $|\Delta R|<1.0$.

In order to select events including sigJ coming from the W/Z hadronically decay, the boson-tagger is applied. The events passing the boson-tagger 50~\% efficiency working point is categorized in the so-called high-purity (HP) signal region (SRVBS\_HP), while failing 50~\% working point but passing 80~\% working point are considered in the low-purity (LP) signal region (SRVBS\_LP). \\ \\ 

\noindent\textbf{\sf{Resolved selection}}  \\
For the bosons with the lower $p_T$ ranges, the boson decays into the two well-separated jets. The two leading-$p_T$ small-R jets are selected as the signal jets candidate, from the rest of the jets after tagging jets selection. Leading-p$_T$ jets selection is optimized to avoid the artificial peak in the backgrounds and to get better sensitivity compared to the former jets selection, where selected two jets with invariant mass closest to the W/Z mass. 
The leading jet is required to have p$_T > 40~\mathrm{GeV}$ and the subleading, p$_T > 20~\mathrm{GeV}$. Their invariant mass (M$^{sig}_{jj}$) should be inside the mass window of 64 < $m_{jj}$ < 106~GeV, near the W/Z mass. Figure~\ref{fig:MVHadResSR} shows that the reconstructed boson peak before requiring the mass window.

%top mass cut
The additional cut is applied to suppress the top contributions discussed in section~\ref{}. A cut to the reconstructed top mass, $m_{jjj}$ > 200~GeV is decided to be applied in the resolved selection. The $m_{jjj}$ is derived with the two signal jets and the third jet which forms the three-jet mass, the closest to the Top mass (172.76~GeV). The $m_{jjj}$ with events with each truth particles is shown, and the modeling plot is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2leptopMass}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/2lep/topMass/WZjjtopMasspeak}

        \caption{ Mass of 3 jets in the 2-lepton channel CRVjet.}
        \label{fig:2leptopMass}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
This top-mass cut can reduce the top contributions, as shown in Table~\ref{fig:TruthTop2LepPurity} in resolved selection, therefore the resolved signal region (denoted as SRVBS\_Tight) is defined with this additional cut to get more VBS-like phase space. In merged selection top-mass cut is applied to the $m_{Jj}$, invariant mass of the large signal jet and the additional jet which make the closest invariant mass to the top mass. It does little thing to enhance the VBS signals since top contribution is already small without the top mass cut, hence this cut is not added to the merged selection.

        \label{fig:TruthTop2LepPurity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Selection of analysis regions}
The signal regions are defined each for merged (SRVBS\_HP, SRVBS\_LP) and resolved (SRVBS\_Tight) selection, according to the selection of the hadronically decaying boson candidates. The all selections applied to define the SRs in each lepton channel is listed in the table.
The control regions (CR) are also defined by converting the definitions of the signal regions to constraint the main background sources.
There are two merged and resolved CR for V+jet (V is Z/W for 0-lepton, W for 1-lepton, Z for 2-lepton channel). There is also Top CR only to constrain the top normalization. Top CR only exists in 1-lepton channel, where contains plenty of top background. To summarize there are 9 SRs and the 6 V+jet CR and one Top CR. All of these are fitted simultaneously in the final statistical imperpretation. 


%Signal regions (SR) are defined to enhance the signal purity, and for background  components the control region (CR). They are defined by requiring the signal jet selections. Defining order starts from merged categories, then move to the resolved category. Each events are categorized into the regions in following order in Figure~\ref{fig:order}. The event selection is performed subsequently, which means only the events failed the previous selection goes to the next selection, therefore there is no events overlapped.
%These five regions are simultaneously fitted in the final fitting.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/order}
    \caption{The order of defining the SR and the CR. The merged SR are defined at first, and the events failed the merged SR selections goes to the selection of the resolved SR, therefore there are no overlapped events within several SR and CRs.}
    \label{fig:order}
\end{figure}

%subsection{Merged category}
%merged selection
%The hadronic decaying $W/Z$ bosons with $p_{T}(W / Z \rightarrow q q) \geq ~200 \mathrm{GeV}$, can be reconstructed with jets as large-R jets. This merged region requires at least one large-R jet outside of the tagging jets of $|\Delta R|<1.4$. 
%The boson-tagger is required to find the reconstructed $W/Z$ bosons and the SRs and CRs are defined. The events passed the boson-tagger working point (WP) at 50$\%$ is categorized to be in the High Purity (HP) Merged SR. The events failed the 50$\%$ WP and passed 80$\%$ goes to the Low Purity (LP) Merged SR. 
%The Merged region definition is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:MergedRegion}.

    \caption{The selection of the merged SR and CR are shown. The CR definition is what was changed from the previous round of the analysis, in order to fulfill the requirement to derive the scale factors.}
    \label{fig:MergedRegion}
\end{figure}
The data and MC distribution of the mass of the large-R jet before and after applying the boson tagger is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2lepfatJet}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/2lep/dataMC/C_0ptag1pfat0pjet_0ptv_MergedCommon_fatJetMass_Log} \\

    \label{fig:2lepfatJet}
\end{figure}

The 50~\% working point (WP) $W/Z$-tagging scale factor is applied for the HP SR, and a custom scale factor is defined for the LP SR:
\begin{equation}
S F_{L P}=\frac{\epsilon_{loose} S F_{eff, loose}-\epsilon_{tight} S F_{eff, tight}}{\epsilon_{loose}-\epsilon_{tight}}
\end{equation}
where "loose" refers to the 80\% WP and "tight" refers to the 50\% WP.

The boson-tagger is optimized to maximize the sensitivity to the longitudinally-polarized $W/Z$ bosons. 
The previous study showed that the HPSR is not so sensitive to the fully-transversed aQGC signals, which makes us to keep the LPSR for the aQGC searches. 

\subsection{Resolved category}
For the bosons with the lower $p_T$ ranges, the boson decays into the two well-separated jets. This is cotegorized as resolved region, with having two signal jets. The two leading-$p_T$ small-R jets are selected from the rest of the jets after tagging jets selection. The leading signal jet is required to be $p_T$ > 40~GeV. 
The events are categorized to the resolved SR when pass the mass window of 64 < $m_{jj}$ < 106~GeV. Figure~\ref{fig:MVHadResSR} shows that the reconstructed boson peak before and after requiring the mass window.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/2lep/dataMC/C_0ptag2pjet_0ptv_ResolvedCommon_MVHadRes_Log}

    \caption{Invariant mass of the two signal jets before and after requiring the mass window. 
    %Before the mass window cut, the $m^{tag}_{jj}$ reweighting is not applied while after mass window cut it is applied, which leads to the difference of the normalization between two plots.
    }
    \label{fig:MVHadResSR}
\end{figure}

After categorization, the invariant mass of the two tagging jets ($\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{jj}}^{\text {tag}}$) is required to be greater than $400~\mathrm{GeV}$ to enhance the VBS-like topology, both for merged and resolved categories.

\subsection{EW top production veto}
\label{subsec:topveto}
The contribution of the EW top production is found to be still significant after applying the b-veto for the tagging jets, which is about 30~\% of the EW VVjj signal in the resolved category after all SR selections so far.
The additional cut is applied to suppress the top contributions for example tZb diagram from the diagram with the Figure~\ref{fig:feynmantZb} included in the EW VVjj signal sample. The top contribution is not the VBS diagrams, while we cannot separate this diagram from VBS ones in the gauge invariant way. Therefore a cut to the reconstructed top mass,$m_{jjj}$ > 200~GeV is decided to be applied. The $m_{jjj}$ is derived with the two signal jets and the third jet which forms the three-jet mass, the closest to the Top mass (172.76~GeV). The $m_{jjj}$ with events with each truth particles is shown, and the modeling plot is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2leptopMass}.

        \caption{ Mass of 3 jets in the 2-lepton channel CRVjet.}
        \label{fig:2leptopMass}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
This top-mass cut can reduce the top contributions, as shown in Table~\ref{fig:TruthTop2LepPurity} in resolved category, therefore the resolved SR is defined with this additional cut to get more VBS-like phase space. In merged category top-mass cut does little thing to enhance the VBS signals since top contribution is already small without the top mass cut, hence this cut is not added to the merged SR definition.

\section{Control Region (CR) definitions}
$V+jets$ CR is defined to constrain the normalization of the backgrounds. For 2-lepton channel, V means Z, which is the main background.
%V+jets CR
For the merged CRs, the single V+jets CRs are defined for the events failing the 80$\%$ WP of the boson tagger. Resolved CRs are defined with using the mass sideband. It is defined with the same event selection as the resolved SR but outside the mass window, which is $50<m_{i i}<64 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, or $m_{i i}>106 ~\mathrm{GeV}$.
The data/MC distribution with respect to the hadronically decaying boson mass for resolved CRs is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CRVjet}.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Mass of reconstructed boson in the resolved CR}
    \label{fig:CRVjet}
\end{figure}

In the merged CR, the inefficiency scale factors $SF_{ineff,loose}$ calaculated for the 80\% working point tagger are applied:
\begin{equation}
S F_{i n e f f}=\frac{1-\epsilon \times S F_{e f f}}{1-\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency estimated in ttbat events for signal and $\gamma$+jet and multi-jet events for background.
%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\noindent \textbf{0-lepton}\\
%The $Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$ identification requires no Loose lepton and high missing energy (E$_T^{miss}$ > 200~GeV) in the final state. There are significant QCD multijet background in 0-lepton channel, therefore some cuts suppressing the multijets are applied: \\
%\\
%- $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>50 \mathrm{GeV}$ \\
%- $\Delta \phi\left(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}, p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\right)<\pi / 2$ \\
%- $\min \left(\Delta \phi\left(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}, j\right)\right)>\pi / 6$ \\
%- $\Delta \phi\left(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}, \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{had}}\right)>\pi / 9$ \\ \\
%where $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ is the track-based missing momentum, and $\min \left(\Delta \phi\left(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}, j\right)\right)$ is the minimum azimuthal difference betwween $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and small-R jets. \\

%\noindent\textbf{1-lepton} \\
%To select the events with $W \rightarrow l\nu$ candidate, exactly one Tight lepton is required.
%In order to suppress the multi-jet background, following cuts are applied for all regions: \\ \\
%- $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text {miss }}>80 \mathrm{GeV}$ \\ 
%- $p_{\mathrm{T}, \ell}>28 \mathrm{GeV}$ \\
%- $m_{J}>50 \mathrm{GeV}$ (merged only) \\ \\

%\noindent\textbf{2-lepton} \\
%The $Z \rightarrow ll$ candidates are selected by requiring two isolated same-flavour Loose leptons. Both leptons required to be $p_T$ > 27~GeV. Opposite charges are required only for muons and not for electrons, since electrons are more sensitive to charge mis-identification due to the conversions of photons from bremsstrahlung, especially at high $E_T$.
%The $m_{ll}$, invariant mass of the dilepton is required to be in the mass window \\ \\
%- $83 < m_{ee}< 99~GeV$ \\ 
%- $\left(85.6-0.0117 p_{\mathrm{T}, \ell \ell}\right)<m_{\mu \mu}<\left(94.0+0.0185 p_{\mathrm{T}, \ell \ell}\right) \mathrm{GeV}$ \\ \\
%The second equation for muons was oprimized from the 2015+16 analysis~\cite{}. 
%The modeling distribution of lepton distribution in the early stage of the selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2lepLeptons}. The mass peak of Z boson can be seen here.

%\section{Signal Regions and Control Regions}
%In all three channels events are required to have a small-R jets pair as a candidate of the forward jets, referred as tagging jets. The another jets pair which is the candidate of the jets hadronically decayed from $W/Z$boson, referred as signal jet is selected as two small-R jets or one large-R jet.
%tagging jet selection
%There needs to be at least four jets, and the tagging jets are first to be selected. Tagging-jets are required to be b-vetoed, which means to be not b-tagged to suppress the contribution of the $Wtb$ vertex in the electroweak VVjj signals. Additionally the fJVT selection is applied to the all small-R jets, with fJVT Loose working point (WP). Tagging jets are selected from the opposite hemispheres, $\eta_{\operatorname{tag} j_{1}} \cdot \eta_{\operatorname{tag} j_{2}}<0$, and to have the highest dijet invariant mass, and each tagging jet is required to be $p_T$ > 30~GeV.

%how to define SR and
%Signal regions (SR) are defined to enhance the signal purity, and for background  components the control region (CR). There are SR and CRs separately in the merged regions and the resolved regions.
%Each events are categorized into the regions in following order in Figure~\ref{fig:order}. These five regions are simultaneously fitted in the final fitting.

%    \label{fig:order}
%\end{figure}

%merged selection
%The hadronic decaying $W/Z$ bosons with $p_{T}(W / Z \rightarrow q q) \geq 200 \mathrm{GeV}$, can be reconstructed with jets as large-R jets. This merged region required at least one large-R jet outside of the tagging jets of $|\Delta R|<1.4$. 
%The boson-tagger is required to find the reconstructed $W/Z$ bosons and the SRs and CRs are defined. The boson-tagger is based on the three variables; jet mass, $D_2$ and $n_Tracks$. The events passed the boson-tagger working point (WP) at 50$\%$ is categorized to be in the High Purity (HP) Merged SR. The events failed the 50$\%$ WP and passed 80$\%$ goes to the Low Purity (LP) Merged SR. 
%The boson-tagger is optimized to maximize the sensitivity to the longitudinally-polarized $W/Z$ bosons. 
%The previous study showed that the HPSR is not so sensitive to the fully-transversed aQGC signals, which makes us to keep the LPSR for the aQGC searches. 
%put here the reference!
%The Merged region definition is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:MergedRegion}.

%\end{figure}


%resolved selection
%For the bosons with the lower $p_T$ ranges, the boson decays into the two well-separated jets. This is cotegorized as resolved region, with having two signal jets. The two small-R jets are selected from the rest of the jets after tagging jets selection. The leading signal jet is required to be $p_T$ > 40~GeV. The events are categorized to the resolved SR when pass the mass window of 64 < $m_{jj}$ 106~GeV. Figure~\ref{fig:MVHadResSR} shows that the reconstructed boson peak.
%This signal-jet selecting strategy is changed from the previous round of the analysis..
%VBS selection and top veto cut
%The event selection is applied to enhance the VBS topology. After categorization the invariant mass of %the two tagging jets ($\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{jj}}^{\text {tag }}$) is greater than $400 \mathrm{GeV}$.
%The additional cut is applied to suppress the top contributions for example tZb diagram from the diagram with the Figure~\ref{fig:feynmantZb} included in the signal sample. The top contribution is not the VBS diagrams, while we cannot separate this diagram in the gauge invariant way. Therefore we decided to reconstruct the top mass with the two signal jets and the third jet which forms the three-jet mass, $m_{jjj}$, the closest to the Top mass (172.76~GeV). The $m_{jjj}$ with events with each truth particles is shown, and the modeling plot is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2leptopMass}.

%Control regions
%There are control regions (CR) are defined to constrain the normalization of the backgrounds. The CRs for the $Z$+jets, $W$+jets, and $t\bar{t}$ events are defined here.
%V+jets CR
%For the merged CRs, the V+jets CRs are defined for the events failing the 80$\%$ WP of the boson tagger. Resolved CRs are defined with using the mass sideband. It is defined with the same event selection as the resolved SR but outside the mass window, which is $50<m_{i i}<64 \mathrm{GeV}$, or $m_{i i}>106 \mathrm{GeV}$.
%top CR
%Top CR is defined only for 1-lepton channel, by requiring at least one b-tagged instead of b-veto. This %Top CR is used for constraining the normalization of the $t\bar{t}$ control region.
