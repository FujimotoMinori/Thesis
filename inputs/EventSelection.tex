\chapter{Event selection}

The summary of the event selection in 2-lep channel is shown in table.

The strategy of the selection is to first select tag jets and then signal jets from the remaining jets.

Tagging jets are required to be non-b-tagged to suppress the contribution of the processes with Wtb vertex.
fJvt selection is applied; to pass the Loose fJvt WP. Loose WP is chosen since it is the default WP recommended[] and no significant difference in efficiency with Tight WP has been observed.
