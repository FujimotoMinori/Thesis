\section{ATLAS Detector}
The ATLAS Detector [11] was designed to measure all standard model particles 2) produced by LHC collisions, a schematic overview of the whole ATLAS detector is shown in Figure 3.2. The detector position surrounding the beam pipe called barrel, and those aligned at the high Î· regions are referred to as end-caps.
The magnet system and the luminosity detector are introduced in Section 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, respectively. Four major subsystems, the inter tracker, the calorimeters, the muon spectrometer, and the trigger & data acquisition system are described.

\subsection{Magnet}
The ATLAS magnet system consists of four large superconducting magnets with a dimension of 22 m in diameter and 26 m in length with a stored energy of 1.6 GJ. A solenoid aligned on the beam axis generates 2 T axial magnetic field for the inner detector, which placed inside the calorimeter system. A toroid on the barrel and two toroids on the end-caps are installed and those provide 0.5 and 1T magnetic fields for muon detectors, respectively.
