The discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 proved the existence of all particles in the Standard Model (SM). 
Although the SM can precisely predict phenomena up to around the electroweak scale, it is still an incomplete theory model, which has problems uncovered. 
It is necessary to explore the possibilities of physics beyond the SM through measurements of the SM processes and searches for new particles. 
The Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) is the important process to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM, and itsâ€™ cross section can be easily modified by the anomalous guage couplings at high transverse momentum of the vector bosons. Therefore the measurement of the VBS is one of the most essential topics int the physics program at the LHC experiment.

This thesis reports the measurement of the electroweak production of a pair of wead vector bosons in association with two hadron jets (VVjj), including the VBS, with the semi-leptonic final states.
The analysis has been done with data collected by the ATLAS detector during whole Run~2 of the LHC, corresponding integrated luminosity of $139^{-1}$fb.
The expected/observed fiducial cross-section of the VVjj process in the semi-leptonic final states is measured to be XXX $\pm$ XXX~fb. The measured results with all three decay channels are interpreted as the limits on the anomalous quartic gauge coupling (aQGC) in terms of the dimension-8 effective fiels theory (EFT).
The limit on each Wilson coefficient obtained is compared to the other analyses channels.
