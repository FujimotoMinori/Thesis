The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 confirmed the existence of all particles in the Standard Model (SM). Although it is confirmed that the SM precisely predicts the phenomena up to around the electroweak scale, it is still an incomplete theory, which has problems uncovered. It is necessary to explore the possibilities of physics beyond the SM through precise measurement of the SM and the search for the new particles. 
The Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) can probe the electroweak sector of the SM, since itsâ€™s scattering cross section can be affected by the existence of the anomalous couplings at high transverse momentum of the vector bosons. Therefore the measurement of the VBS is one of the key topics of the precise measurement performed in the LHC experiment.
This thesis reports the measurement of the weak vector boson scattering process with semi-leptonic final states, especially in 2-lepton channel (WZ/ZZ + jj -> llqq + jj) with data collected by the ATLAS detector during whole Run 2 of the LHC, which integrated luminosity is 139 -1fb.
The expected/observed signal-strength and fiducial cross-section of the weak vector boson scattering process with semi-leptonic final states only in 2-lepton channel is reported.
 The measured results with all three decay channels ( 0-lepton,1-lepton,2-lepton channel ) are interpreted into the anomalous quartic gauge coupling (aQGC) search in terms of the dimension-8 effective field theory (EFT). The limits on each Wilson coefficient obtained are compared to the ones from other analyses.
