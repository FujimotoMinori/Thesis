The discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has confirmed the existence of the all particles described in the standard model (SM), though there is still problems that cannot be explained by the SM. In that sense, SM is still an incomplete theory. The precise measurement accompanying the Higgs boson discovery represents the further understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking. The vector boson scattering study can probe whether the source of the electroweak symmetry breaking comes only from the Higgs mechanism. The scattering amplitude at high transverse momentum of the vector bosons can be affected by the existence of a new physics that modify the quartic gauge couplings.
Measurements of the vector boson scattering is one of the key topic of the precise measurement performed in the LHC experiment since it can verify the electroweak sector of the SM. 

This thesis reports the measurement of the weak vector boson scattering process with semileptonic final states, especially in 2-lepton channel (WZ/ZZ + jj $\rightarrow$ llqq + jj) with data collected by the ATLAS detector during whole Run2 of the LHC, which integrated luminosity is 139$^{^1}fb$.

The weak vector boson scattering process with semileptonic final states in 2-lepton channel is measured with expected significance of
* standard deviations. The fiducial cross-section is measure to be * fb $\pm$ * $\pm$.

The measured results are interpreted to the anomalous quartic gauge coupling (aQGC) search in terms of the dimension-8 effective field theory (EFT). The limits obtained are compared to the ones from other analyses.
