%% fiducial cross section extraction
The predicted fiducial cross-section is summerized in table in each fiducial category.
They are derived from the 

The predictions are from the MADGRAPH5 aMC@NLO 2.4.3 event generator at the LO only, and no higher-order corrections are included; 
the theoretical uncertainties due to the PDF, missing higher-order corrections, and parton shower modeling are estimated as described in Section 6.7.
