The standard model may violate its unitary at high invariant mass{$m_{VV}$}.
The VBS preocess is one of the most importatnt processes 

An excess of the observed data over the SM prediction was rejected  with observed (expected) significance of 5.90 (6.04)~$\sigma$.

The measured signal-strength is $\mu_{obs} = 0.98^{+ 0.09}_{- 0.09}(\mathrm{Stat})^{+ 0.21}_{- 0.18}(\mathrm{Syst})$. 
The fiducial cross-section of EW VV+jj is measured to be $\sigma_{EW VV+jj} = * \pm * $~fb.

The measurement of EW VV+jj processes is consistent with the SM prediction, hence the resuts are interpreted as limits on coefficients of the dimension-8 EFT operators.

%The standard model predicts that the electroweak symmetry breaking completely changed the vacuum structure at the early universe and, consequently, masses of elementally particles were generated. Thanks to enough center-of-mass energy of the LHC to generate two on-shell electroweak bosons, the most important process to examine the electroweak symmetry breaking, vector boson scattering can be studied at the LHC. This thesis presents the first search for the EWVVjj processes and anomalous quartic gauge couplings with the semileptonic final states at the ATLAS detector with an integrated luminosity of 139 fbâˆ’1 corresponding to data collected in Run-2 of the experiment.

%An excess of the observed data over the expected background from the SM without EWVVjj processes is observed with the observed (expected) significance of * (*) standard deviations.
