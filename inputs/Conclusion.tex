In this thesis the measurement of the electroweak production of two vector bosons associated with a pair of jets is presented.
The semileptonic channel is studied using the full Run-2 dataset of the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139~fb$^{-1}$.



%The standard model predicts that the electroweak symmetry breaking completely changed the vacuum structure at the early universe and, consequently, masses of elementally particles were generated. Thanks to enough center-of-mass energy of the LHC to generate two on-shell electroweak bosons, the most important process to examine the electroweak symmetry breaking, vector boson scattering can be studied at the LHC. This thesis presents the first search for the EWVVjj processes and anomalous quartic gauge couplings with the semileptonic final states at the ATLAS detector with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 corresponding to data collected in Run-2 of the experiment.

%The main sources of background for the semileptonic VBS analysis are the V+jets and tt ̄ processes. It is eliminated by making use of the signal event topology expected from Feynman diagrams. 
%An excess of the observed data over the expected background from the SM without EWVVjj processes is observed with the observed (expected) significance of * (*) standard deviations. The measured
%signal-strength is $μ_{obs}$ = * = * ± * (stat.)+ * (syst.). The fiducial cross-section of EW VVjj *fb ,obs *.  EWVVjj is measured to be σEW VVjj = * ± *(stat.)*(syst.) fb.

%Since the measurement of EWVVjj processes is consistent with the SM, the results are interpreted as limits on coefficients of the dimension-8 EFT operators. Given limits on coefficients, fS0 to fS2, fM0 to fM7, and fT0 to fT9 are the most stringent to date.
