The EW VV+jj production with semi-leptonic final state is measured with the significance of 5.97 (6.04)~$\sigma$.

The measured signal-strength is $\mu_{obs} = 0.98^{+ 0.09}_{- 0.09}(\mathrm{Stat})^{+ 0.21}_{- 0.18}(\mathrm{Syst})$. 
The fiducial cross-section of EW VV+jj is measured to be $\sigma_{EW VV+jj} = * \pm * $~fb.

The measurement of EW VV+jj processes is consistent with the SM prediction, hence the results are interpreted as limits on coefficients of the dimension-8 EFT operators.
