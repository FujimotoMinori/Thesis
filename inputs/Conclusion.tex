In this thesis, the vector boson scattering (VBS) in semileptonic final states is studied as the production of a pair of vector bosons associated with a pair of forward jets (EW VV+jj). 
The study is performed using the full Run-2 dataset collected by the ATLAS detector during 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139~fb$^{-1}$.
The analysis resulted in a measured signal strength of $\mu_{obs} = 0.98^{+ 0.09}_{- 0.09}(\mathrm{Stat})^{+ 0.21}_{- 0.18}(\mathrm{Syst})$.
The background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 5.90 (6.04)~$\sigma$, claims the observation of the EW VV+jj signal in semileptonic final state. 
The fiducial cross-section of EW VV+jj process is measured to be $\sigma_{EW VV+jj} = * \pm * $~fb.
The measurement of EW VV+jj processes is consistent with the SM prediction, hence the results are interpreted as limits on coefficients of the dimension-8 EFT operators.
