In this thesis, the vector boson scattering (VBS) in semileptonic final states is studied as the production of a pair of vector bosons associated with a pair of forward jets (EW VV+jj). 

The study is performed using the full Run-2 dataset collected by the ATLAS detector during 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139~fb$^{-1}$.
The analysis resulted in a measured signal strength of $\mu_{obs} = 0.98^{+ 0.09}_{- 0.09}(\mathrm{Stat})^{+ 0.21}_{- 0.18}(\mathrm{Syst})$.
The background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 5.9 (6.5)~$\sigma$, therefore claiming the observation of the EW VV+jj signal in semileptonic final state. 
Compared to the previous analysis with an integrated luminosity of 35.5~fb$^{-1}$~\cite{STDM-2017-20}, the significance is improved from 2.7 (2.5) to 5.9 (6.5).
Extrapolating the luminosity from 35.5~fb$^{-1}$ to 139~fb$^{-1}$ gives a naive estimation of the significance of about 4~$\sigma$.
The significant improvements to push for more than 5~$\sigma$ can be attributed to several reasons; the updated jet reconstruction using PFlow algorithm, and the updated W/Z boson tagger using 3-variables instead of 2-variables (mass and D2 requirements) previously. 
These updates related to the jet reconstruction and selection are validated well in terms of the background modeling and the fitting in this thesis.
The signal strength is used to obtain the fiducial cross section and compared with other analyses.
%more precise estimation of the JES/JER uncertainties using the full Run~2 dataset
%good discriminant power of the new RNN 
%The fiducial cross-section of EW VV+jj process is measured to be $\sigma_{EW VV+jj} = * \pm * $~fb.
The measurement of EW VV+jj processes is consistent with the SM prediction, hence the results are interpreted as limits on coefficients of the dimension-8 EFT operators.
