The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes the fundamental particles composing matters in nature and the interactions among them. 
The discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments confirmed the existence of all particles in the SM~\cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028}. 
Although the SM can predict precisely phenomena up to around the electroweak scale, it is still an incomplete theory model, as there are several phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM such as the existence of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. 
It is necessary to explore the physics beyond the SM (BSM) through both precise measurements of the SM processes and direct searches of the new particles.

%(2)
One of the most important topics of the research program is to reveal the underlying mechanism behind the electroweak symmetry breaking, and the precise understanding of the electroweak sector of the SM. 
The electroweak symmetry breaking can be tested in detail by investigating the properties of the VBS since it is sensitive to interactions between the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons.

%
In addition, in case the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking is not unity or there is a new resonant state at the energy scale that cannot be explored directly at the LHC, the VBS cross section is expected to be modified by the interactions involving the new particle.

%(3)
Experimentally, the VBS signature is characterized by the presence of a pair of vector bosons (W, Z, or $\gamma$) and two forward jets with a large separation in rapidity and a large dijet invariant mass.
Both ATLAS and CMS discovered the VBS process~\cite{STDM-2017-19,CMS-SMP-20-001}
%in the same-sign $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj$ channel \cite{}, $WZjj$ channel, $ZZjj$ channel 
with 5 standard deviations from the null hypothesis in the full-leptonic final state, but due to the small branching ratio, the measurement can reach the energy scale of new physics only up to around 500~GeV.

To cover a wider mass range up to TeV, the VBS measurement including the semi-leptonic final states are needed.

This thesis reports the measurement of the electroweak production of the pair of vector bosons in association with two hadron jets, including VBS, in the semi-leptonic final states.

The main challenge of the semi-leptonic channel ( $V(qq')Z(\nu\nu)$, $V(qq')W(l\nu)$ and $V(qq')Z(ll)$ (V = W, Z)) is the presence of large backgrounds from $W + $jets, $Z + $jets and $t\bar{t}$ events. 
These backgrounds make a VBS measurement in this channel challenging, but despite that, the semi-leptonic channel has some advantages compared to the full-leptonic channel. 
The hadronically decaying branching fractions are much larger than the leptonically decaying branching fractions which benefit especially in high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ region and the use of jet substructure techniques allows good background rejection despite its high branching ratio. 

%(4)
Another advantage of the semi-leptonic channel is a suitable channel not only for the SM cross-section measurement but also for its interpretation into the BSM physics with more statistics compared to the full-leptonic channel in the phase space with high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) of the vector bosons and at a high invariant mass of the diboson system.
A common way of parameterizing BSM physics in VBS is through an effective field theory (EFT) \cite{Longhitano:1980tm}, which is a model-independent approach to avoid focussing on a specific BSM theory. In the EFT framework, VBS can be modified.
