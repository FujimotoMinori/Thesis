\chapter{Multi-Variate Analysis}

In order to improve the separation with respect to the other SM background processes, we use a Machine Learning approach for the analysis. The approach adopted in this analysis is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture.

\section{Optimization of the binning}
The optimization of the binning is needed to get the optimal performance of the RNN. The transformation of the RNN output to optimise the effect of the final sensitivity and reduction in the number of bins is implemented.

The Transformation D~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-009} is implemented.
For the current analysis, z$_s$ = 10, z$_b$ = 5 is used for the optimal parameter. In addition, MC statistical uncertainty in each bin is required to be $<$ 20~\% to minimise the bias on fitted $\mu$~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-009}.
